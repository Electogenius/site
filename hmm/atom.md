# Bye, Atom

___

https://github.blog/2022-06-08-sunsetting-atom/. what??????????????????????????????

well, i've been using vscode[^1] since I tried flutter, so i don't really use atom anymore. but atom looks much better than vscode, i mean look at this:

| atom | vscode |
| ---- | ------ |
| ![](/assets/atom-1.png) | ![](/assets/vscode-1.png) | 
| ![](/assets/atom-2.png) | ![](/assets/vscode-2.png) |

well yes it is subjective (imo rounded corners are better, and you can probably install extensions/themes so it looks like atom) but why sunsetting a wonderful text editor? but in the end there's nothing to do other than leaving atom.
